## **PyCity Schools Analysis**

Overall, for the whole district 75% of students were passing math, 86% of students were passing reading, and 65% of students were both math and reading. 

When test scores were broken down by schools, a few of trends emerged: 

- All of the highest performing schools were charter schools. For all of the charter schools, the overall passing rate for students for both math and reading was 90%. The "worst" performing charter school still had 89% of students passing both math and reading. 

- All of the lowest performing schools were district schools. For all of the district schools, the overall passing rate for students for both math and reading was 54%. The best performing charter school only had 55% of students passing both math and reading. 

    - Another possible explanation for this trend is that charter schools have less students. When broken down by size, all charter schools are small (<1000 students) or medium (1000-2000 students) sized. Districts on the other hand are all large- sized schools with 2000 to 5000 students in each school.

- For both math and reading scores, when broken down by grades, there appears to be no real difference across grades within the same school.

- For spending, it appears that schools that spend less per student actually perform better than schools that spend more per student. For schools that spend less than $585/student, 90% of students pass both math and reading, and schools that spend $585 to $630/student, 81% of students pass both math and reading. For schools that spend $630 to $645/student only 63% pass both math and reading, and schools that spend more than $645/student only 53% pass both math and reading. This could also be because large schools have much larger budgets overall.

- For school size, large schools perform much worse than small and medium sized schools. For small schools that have less than 1000 students, 90% of students pass both math and reading, and medium schools that have between 1000 to 2000 students, almost 91% of students pass both math and reading. 

These trends taken together point to either ***school size*** or ***school type*** as the primary driver of differences in test scores across the 15 schools in the district.
